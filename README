This readme will be added to eventually

Written and test only in python 3.6

Ubuntu:

pip3 install the-ends

python3 -m the_ends <your_textfile_with_equations>

**************************************
What it can and can't do at this moment
**************************************
It is not case sensitive for variables names
A single variable must be on the left (hoping to fix this in the future)
A new line designates a new equation (with which an equation can have only on equals sign)

It can: 
	reorder equations to solve them in the proper order 
	do most basic math operations

It can't (but hopefully in the future):
	Deal with implicitly linked equations
	work outside of floating point doubles
	have more than one '=' on one line
