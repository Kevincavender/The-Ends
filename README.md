# THEENDS (The Ends)
THermodynamic Engineering Equations NeeD Solving

## Work in progress
Working on open-sourced equation solver for the needs of a Thermo-Fluids Mechanical Engineer. 

## future libraries to integrate
### pint
    :for unit checking and conversion
    https://github.com/hgrecco/pint
    https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/0.8/index.html

### uncertainties
    :for calculating and propogating uncertainties
    http://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/#future-developments

### zunzun3
    :for curve fitting
    https://github.com/zunzun/pyeq3

### CoolProp
    :thermodynamic properties (open-source)
    http://coolprop.sourceforge.net/

### Refprop
    :non-open thermodynamic properties

### Numpy
    :hard maths and arrays

### scipy
    :hard maths

### matplotlib
    :plotting shtuff

### kivy
    :gui things (may change, idk)
    only one that currently deploys to all os's
    and has multitouch support

### version control
    :likely some kind of github/git compatibility
